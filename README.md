# URL Shortener Microservice

This express project is my implementation of [FCC Backend URL Shortener Microservice challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice). It permits the client to enter a long form URL and have returned a shortened version which can be used later to reach the site. 

You can see deployed [microservice here](https://highfalutin-dragonfruit.glitch.me).
